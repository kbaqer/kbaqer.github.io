I am a Principal Product Security Engineer at [Entrust](https://www.entrust.com) (previously: nCipher Security), since January 2019.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) ([Security Group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/); [Computer Laboratory](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/)), supervised by [Professor Ross Anderson](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/). My thesis was published in November 2018: Baqer, K. (2018). *[Resilient payment systems (Doctoral thesis)](https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.32372)*. I did my Master of Information Technology (Honours) at Monash University (Melbourne, Australia). I did my undergraduate at Georgetown University (Washington D.C.).
