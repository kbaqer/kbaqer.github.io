# DigiTally

DigiTally is an overlay payment scheme for use on mobile phones, whose
goals are to extend mobile phone payments to areas with poor
connectivity and reduce transaction fees. DigiTally enables two people
to do a payment transaction by simply copying short strings of numbers
between their phones. This doesn\'t need either smartphones or a network
connection. Either phone can upload the transaction later, once it gets
a network connection. A short-term goal was a pilot project to explore
the factors that affect payment service uptake.

## Overview

![DigiTally phones](../../docs/DigiTally_phones.JPG)

Mobile payments are available in many less developed countries. There
are over 200 operators worldwide, and mobile payments have been
transformative in as many as 20 such countries. They can support local
payments, migrant remittances, and other financial services such as
microcredit, savings, and access to government welfare and subsidies.

The Gates Foundation called for proposals for a means of extending
mobile payments to people living in areas with poor or no network
service. We created a model, called DigiTally, that enables two people
to do a payment transaction by simply copying short strings of numbers
between their phones. This doesn\'t need either smartphones or a network
connection. Either phone can upload the transaction later, once it gets
a network connection.

The goal of the project was to develop and test a mobile electronic
purse system, whose design and implementation will be put in the public
domain, so that anyone can use it. The idea was to extend phone payment
systems so that people can make payments in areas that have no network,
or where service is intermittent or congested. It can also enable
payment service providers who are not phone companies and who therefore
face nonzero marginal network costs to cut these costs by making small
or repeat transactions on a store-and-forward basis. Our plan was to
develop our design into a model that we can test in the field.
